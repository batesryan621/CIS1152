# Lab 6 Instructions

<<<<<<< HEAD
Given the code in this file complete index so that it works just like lab 5. Make sure that you put all programming logic in a method.
=======
In lab 2 we created 4 functions. Those functions did not have any interfaces. Create a web page that acts as an interface and self posts the results back to the page.  To complete this lab, you will need the following functions.

You will also need the following SUPER GLOBAL array.

`$_POST[]` -> An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method. [`$_POST[]` API Documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.post.php)

You will also need to remember how to build an HTML form. [W3C `Form` API Documentation](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html).

Make sure that you complete the PHPDoc documentation for this assignment.
